## Update Environment Variables
Make sure your path environment variables are updated for PhantomJS, CasperJS and Cmder with the executable path.
Depending on where you installed the software the paths will be similar to:
- C:\Program Files\nodejs\
- C:\phantomjs
- C:\casperjs\batchbin

## Check Prerequisities
After the executables paths have been added to your environment variables you can check they are installed correctly using the following commands from the command line:
- node --version
- phantomjs --version
- casperjs --version

If everything is installed correctly each command will return the curent version details.
