# Open Submitter Article Submissions

Open Submitter article submission files contain the following information:
- Title of article to be submitted in spin text.
- Description of article in spin text.
- Body of article in spin text.
- Keywords in spin text and comma separated.
- Link URLs in spin text and comma separated.
- Image URLs in spin text and comma separated.

## Using Spin Syntax

Spin syntax is used to allow Open Submitter to create unlimited unique articles to be submitted to services. Spin is surrunded by curly brackets {} and synonyms are separated by pipe symbols | e.g.

**Phrase:**

My great blog post.

**Spin Syntax:**


{My|A|This is a|A really} {great|awesome|cool} {blog post|article|review|commentary}

**Example results after spinning**

A cool commentary

A really awesome commentary

A great review

This is a cool blog post

My great commentary

**Important Note**

Do not nest spin as it will give unpredictable results with Open Submitter. e.g.

Don't use this:

{{this|this2}|this3}

Only use this:

{this|this2|this3}

## Add Link Tags to Article

To create backlinks in your article body and description where you want insert link tags (#links#). Open Submitter will insert a random keyword with a random link from the article keyword and link list. If no link tags are put in, Open Submitter will place one at the end. Do not insert too many link tags as search engines may reject the article as spam. Don't exceed one link per two paragraphs. The best results will come from having only one link only in the article body and description. Do not put links in title as these will not be recognised by Open Submitter.

## Add keywords, links.

Keywords and links need to be supplied for Open Submitter to use. These are comma separated. Open Submitter will select randomly. Spin syntax can be used to group together long tail keywords and less important links. This way you can influence the ratio of selection of links and keywords.



## Add Images

Images make articles look more interesting and less spammy. Open Submitter selects images at random from the images list supplied. These are comma separated URLs. The imgaes are randomly located vertically and randomly floating left or right. Please note not all services accept images.
