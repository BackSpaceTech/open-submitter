# Open Submitter Article Submissions

Open Submitter article submission files contain the following information:
- Title of article to be submitted in spin text.
- Description of article in spin text.
- Body of article in spin text.
- Keywords in spin text and comma separated.
- Link URLs in spin text and comma separated.
- Image URLs in spin text and comma separated.

## Using Spin Syntax

Spin syntax is used to allow Open Submitter to create unlimited unique articles to be submitted to services. Spin is surrunded by curly brackets {} and synonyms are separated by pipe symbols | e.g.

**Phrase:**

My great blog post.

**Spin Syntax:**


{My|A|This is a|A really} {great|awesome|cool} {blog post|article|review|commentary}

**Example results after spinning**

A cool commentary

A really awesome commentary

A great review

This is a cool blog post

My great commentary

**Important Note**

Do not nest spin as it will give unpredictable results with Open Submitter. e.g.

Don't use this:

{{this|this2}|this3}

Only use this:

{this|this2|this3}
